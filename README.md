The goal here was to see the Percent change in students aged 12-17 per state in the IDEA.

Once the data was collected and put into maps on Tableau, I decided to see if there was a coorelation in population percent change and the students percent change. So I pulled census data in from 2014-2020 so see if there was a coorelation. I did this using Matplotlib in Pandas. That can be found on the IDEA.ipynb.
